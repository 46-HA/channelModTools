# Channel Mod Tools (name tbd)

Channel Mod Tools is a set of custom built moderation tools for the Hack Club Slack (or any Slack workplace that's not on enterprise).

Slack doesn't come with good moderation tools like slow mode, read only mode, channel banning/muting, or thread locking out of the box, and
it made moderation challenging for us.

This is still a WIP!
